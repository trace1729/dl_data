## Detailed Examples and Optimization Techniques
### ALU Optimization Examples
Focused on **inefficient carry handling** and **logic sharing**.  

| Example ID | Suboptimal Design      | Optimization           | Performance Impact      | Power Impact          | Area Impact          |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| 1          | Separate add/sub units | Shared adder           | Reduced critical path   | Lower gate count      | Smaller footprint    |
| 12         | Multiple operations    | Shared logic           | Faster operation        | Reduced power         | Less area            |

**Example**:
